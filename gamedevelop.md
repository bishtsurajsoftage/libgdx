# [SideFX Labs](https://github.com/sideeffects/SideFXLabs)
The GameDev Toolset has been rebranded as SideFXLabs as these tools are useful for more than game development. See the [SideFX Labs](https://github.com/sideeffects/SideFXLabs) repo for the latest changes.

# Game Development Toolset
This is a  series of tools geared towards assisting Houdini users with a variety of tasks for game development. The older version of this repository focused on just the shelf. Now this is an all-inclusive toolset that 
spans the shelf, digital assets, custom desktops and scripts.

If you'd like more information, please check out [Game Development Toolset Overview](https://www.sidefx.com/tutorials/game-development-toolset-overview/), which contains tutorials for several of the provided
tools.

NOTE: This is in-progress. Please file an [Issue](https://github.com/sideeffects/GameDevelopmentToolset/issues) if something doesn't seem quite right!

Also, if you forked the repository and suddenly it stopped pulling, that's due to the repository name changing from game development shelf to game development toolset. Github appears to forward traffic to the
new link, but here's a little FYI just in case.

# Installation

You can install the Game Development Toolset from the updater built in to Houdini 16.5+ or you can manually download the sources from github.

## Method 1 (Recommended): Built in Updater
Use the built in Updater from github. and download the repository using git clone or download button and unzip contents into the folder of your choosing.

# What's Changed?
Hi, my name is Luiz Kruel and I have taken over the github from Steven B. who is now working in production. A few of the SideFX TA (TDs) will also be contributing example files and tools.

We haven't done a lot in this Github in a while, but we are changing that. The original thought was that new tools would go straight into the build and the Github would eventually be phased out.

But we saw a lot of value  in having this experimental testbed for tools, so we will continue to develop our tools live and as they mature they will move inot the main Houdini Build.
